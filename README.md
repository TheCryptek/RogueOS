RogueOS 1.0

This is an OS for OpenComputers mod for minecraft. As of RogueOS 1.0 it is being written
on or over OpenOS' files. After I am well versed in making an OS in Lua for OpenComputers
then RogueOS will not use files from OpenOS. ##[Remember to thank payonel for OpenOS or 
RogueOS would never have started to become a thing.]
